                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript  is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
                    It is asmall light weight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to 
                    take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside 
                    environment (a web browser of Node server), it can be conenected to 
                    the objects of these environment to provide programmatic control Over
                    them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript
                        variables are container for strong data values -imagine
                    a cup of you fill with coffee, the cup holds a variable. All Javascript variables 
                must identified with unique names.These unique names are called
            identifiers, <span>var x;</span></li>
                        <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators
                        assigns values to JavaScript variables -our cup can now 
                    have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The 
                    assignment operator assignsa value to a variable <span>.var x=10;</span> </li>
                        <li><a href="#">DataTypes </a>DataTypes are an important concept;
                         to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data DataTypesthere are six 
                        data types that are JAvaScript primitives : Boolean- <span>true</span>
                     oe <span>false;</span> null- <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number- <span>42</span>
                     or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>
                    Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object- <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                        <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write a code, you want to
                        perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different
                    code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional 
                statment in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
            statments: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code 
        in our cod block: <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the 
    first condition is false: <span>else</span> we execute this block of code</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but 
                        all essentialy do the samething: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile,
                    well you run around the tracks four times and then you stop.Thats aloop!</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of acode block.
                        When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instruction.
                    As an examp;e imagine we reputting together a desk from Ikea, we open up
                the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top: next we p;ace
             the tablethe right way up. Done! we finished our instruction. Saadly 
            there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again. </li>
                    </ul>
